<h2>6th grade</h2>
<p>6th grade is great...except for the fact that it means middle school.</p>
<p>My dad is teaching me HTML so I am tring it out.</p>
<p>I wish I could meet you all face to face.</p>
<p>I also wish I was doing python right now but I need to first learn this to ever get to that stage.</p>
<p>How rude of me I forgot to introduce myself, I am stacystar1 and I go to Hart School Middle.</p>
<p>Lunch is loud and after I have math which I am amazing at.</p>
<p>Inside the school is awesome and I wish you could see it but you are not here so you cant see the student store or here the noisy croud or even smell the mix of foods that there is.</p>
<p>Wait I forgot to explain the begining of the day, So after I get of the bus and to my first class I get out everything that I will need and write down all my homework. </p>
<p>After that my teacher takes attendence and checks the DOL and we work on grammerflip.</p>
<p>Then we work on a project or play a game but during passing period I dont have to move to another class because I have block first thing.</p>
<p>Then when we come back we scilent read and continue the activit or progect we were working on for the rest of the period.</p>
<p>After passing period our histor part of block starts and we immediatly grab our textbooks and notebooks to start answering the focas questions and sometimes do a art activity.</p>
