<h2>6th grade</h2>
<p>6th grade is great...except for the fact that it means middle school.</p>
<p>My dad is teaching me HTML so I am tring it out.</p>
<p>I wish I could meet you all face to face.</p>
<p>I also wish I was doing python right now but I need to first learn this to ever get to that stage.</p>
<p>How rude of me I forgot to introduce myself, I am stacystar1 (that isn't my real name) I am in 6th grade and go to Thomas Hart Middle school.</p>
